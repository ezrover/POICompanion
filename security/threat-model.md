# Roadtrip-Copilot Threat Model

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** August 7, 2025
**Author:** Gemini (`SecuritySentinel` Agent)

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the threat model for the Roadtrip-Copilot system. The purpose of this analysis is to proactively identify, assess, and mitigate security risks in the application architecture. We use the **STRIDE methodology**, which categorizes threats into six types: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege.

## 2. System Overview & Key Assets

- **Key Assets:**
    - **User Data:** Personally Identifiable Information (PII), location history, preferences, payment information.
    - **POI RAG Database:** The core "Crown Jewel" asset containing proprietary, AI-distilled location intelligence.
    - **Global Crowdsourcing Network:** Contributor data, reputation scores, and payment details.
    - **Service Availability:** The uptime and reliability of the Roadtrip-Copilot service.
    - **Proprietary Code & AI Models:** The algorithms and models that power the system.

- **Attack Surfaces:**
    - Mobile Applications (iOS & Android)
    - Automotive Interfaces (CarPlay & Android Auto)
    - Backend APIs (Cloudflare Workers)
    - Database (Supabase PostgreSQL)
    - Crowdsourcing Chrome Extension
    - Third-Party API Integrations (Google, Yelp, Stripe)

## 3. STRIDE Threat Analysis

### 3.1. Spoofing

*Impersonating someone or something else.*

| Threat ID | Threat Description | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **S-01** | An attacker impersonates a legitimate user to access their data or perform actions on their behalf. | - Implement strong, multi-factor authentication (MFA) via Supabase Auth.<br>- Use short-lived JWTs with secure refresh token rotation.<br>- Monitor for suspicious login patterns (e.g., multiple failed attempts, logins from unusual locations). |
| **S-02** | A malicious actor impersonates a POI owner to tamper with business information. | - Implement a robust business verification process for the POI Owner Portal.<br>- Require documentation (e.g., utility bills, business registration) for verification.<br>- Use two-factor authentication for POI owner accounts. |
| **S-03** | An attacker spoofs a response from a third-party API (e.g., Yelp) to inject malicious data. | - Use TLS for all external API communications.<br>- Implement certificate pinning to ensure the app only communicates with trusted servers.<br>- Validate and sanitize all incoming data from external APIs. |

### 3.2. Tampering

*Modifying data or code.*

| Threat ID | Threat Description | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **T-01** | A malicious contributor submits false or malicious data to poison the RAG database. | - Implement a multi-layer validation system for all crowdsourced data (AI pre-screening + 3-5 human reviewers).<br>- Develop a reputation score for contributors; weight submissions from high-reputation users more heavily.<br>- Use data-provenance tracking to identify and revert malicious contributions. |
| **T-02** | An attacker intercepts and modifies API requests between the mobile app and the backend (Man-in-the-Middle). | - Enforce HTTPS (TLS 1.3) for all client-server communication.<br>- Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).<br>- Sign critical API requests to ensure their integrity. |
| **T-03** | An attacker modifies the application package on a jailbroken/rooted device to bypass security controls. | - Implement root/jailbreak detection in the mobile apps.<br>- Use code obfuscation and anti-tampering tools (e.g., DexGuard for Android, iXGuard for iOS).<br>- Perform critical security checks on the server-side, not just the client-side. |

### 3.3. Repudiation

*Claiming that you didn't do something.*

| Threat ID | Threat Description | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **R-01** | A user disputes a payment for a roadtrip, claiming they never authorized it. | - Log all payment authorization requests and responses from the payment gateway (Stripe).<br>- Require explicit user confirmation (e.g., Face ID, Touch ID, password) for all purchases.<br>- Maintain a detailed audit trail of all user actions leading to a purchase. |
| **R-02** | A POI owner denies making a malicious change to their business profile. | - Implement a comprehensive audit log for all changes made through the POI Owner Portal.<br>- Log the user ID, IP address, timestamp, and specific changes made for every action.<br>- Send email notifications to the POI owner for any critical changes to their profile. |

### 3.4. Information Disclosure

*Exposing information to someone not authorized to see it.*

| Threat ID | Threat Description | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I-01** | An attacker gains access to the Supabase database and exfiltrates user PII or location data. | - Enforce strict Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase to ensure users can only access their own data.<br>- Use network policies to restrict database access to only authorized services (e.g., the Cloudflare Workers).<br>- Encrypt sensitive data at rest in the database.<br>- Regularly rotate database credentials and store them securely (e.g., in Cloudflare secrets). |
| **I-02** | A vulnerability in the mobile app exposes sensitive user data stored on the device. | - Store all sensitive data (API tokens, user preferences) in the secure enclave (iOS Keychain / Android Keystore).<br>- Encrypt the local cache database (e.g., using SQLCipher).<br>- Prevent sensitive data from being written to system logs. |
| **I-03** | An API endpoint inadvertently leaks data belonging to other users. | - Implement strict authorization checks on every API endpoint.<br>- The default policy should be to deny access.<br>- Write extensive integration tests to verify that one user cannot access another user's data. |

### 3.5. Denial of Service (DoS)

*Making a system or service unavailable.*

| Threat ID | Threat Description | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **D-01** | An attacker floods the API gateway with a high volume of requests, overwhelming the service. | - Utilize Cloudflare's built-in DDoS protection.<br>- Implement rate limiting on all public API endpoints, based on IP address and authenticated user ID.<br>- Use edge caching to serve frequently requested, non-sensitive data, reducing the load on the origin. |
| **D-02** | An attacker submits a large volume of computationally expensive queries (e.g., complex geographic searches) to drain resources. | - Implement application-level rate limiting for expensive queries.<br>- Add complexity limits to search queries (e.g., maximum search radius).<br>- Monitor resource usage and temporarily block users who exhibit abusive behavior. |
| **D-03** | A malicious contributor submits "poison data" to the crowdsourcing platform, causing the RAG system's processing to fail or enter an infinite loop. | - Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data submitted through the crowdsourcing platform.<br>- Run the AI processing in a sandboxed environment with strict timeouts.<br>- Automatically quarantine data that causes processing failures for manual review. |

### 3.6. Elevation of Privilege

*Gaining capabilities without proper authorization.*

| Threat ID | Threat Description | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **E-01** | A standard user finds a vulnerability that allows them to gain administrative privileges in the system. | - Adhere to the Principle of Least Privilege for all system components and user roles.<br>- Separate user authentication and authorization from business logic.<br>- Use a battle-tested library for role-based access control (RBAC).<br>- Regularly perform security code reviews and penetration testing to identify privilege escalation vulnerabilities. |
| **E-02** | A vulnerability in the POI Owner Portal allows one business owner to modify the data of another business. | - Implement strict ownership checks on every action within the portal, tied to the authenticated user's ID.<br>- Use non-guessable, unique identifiers (UUIDs) for all database records.<br>- Write specific tests to ensure a user cannot perform actions on resources they do not own. |

## 4. Conclusion & Next Steps

This threat model provides a foundational analysis of the security landscape for Roadtrip-Copilot. It is a living document and should be updated as new features are added and the system architecture evolves.

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1.  Integrate the mitigation strategies outlined here into the development backlog.
2.  Develop secure coding guidelines based on these findings.
3.  Implement automated security scanning tools (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline.
