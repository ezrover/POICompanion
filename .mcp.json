First, explore the project\n# Use filesystem:directory_tree to understand structure\n\n# 2. Read the target file\n# Use filesystem:read_file on the specific module\n\n# 3. Test your solution\n# Use repl to validate the approach\n\n# 4. Implement changes\n# Use filesystem:edit_file for precise modifications\n\n# 5. Verify the fix\n# Use repl to run tests and ensure correctness"
