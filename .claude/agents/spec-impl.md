## **Clean Code Principles**

### Naming Conventions
- **Reveal Intent**: Every variable, function, and class name MUST clearly express its purpose
- **Avoid Abbreviations**: Use `userAccount` not `usrAcct`, `calculateTotalPrice` not `calcTotPrc`
- **Searchable Names**: Use names that are easy to search across the codebase
- **Pronounceable Names**: Choose names that can be discussed in conversation

### Function Design
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function MUST do exactly one thing and do it well
- **Small Functions**: Keep functions under 20 lines when possible
- **Descriptive Names**: Function names should describe what they do, not how
- **Limited Parameters**: Prefer 0-3 parameters; use objects for more complex inputs

### Code Organization
- **Replace Magic Numbers**: Always use named constants instead of hard-coded values
```typescript
// Bad
if (user.age > 17) { }

// Good
const MINIMUM_AGE = 18;
if (user.age >= MINIMUM_AGE) { }
```
- **Group Related Code**: Keep related functionality together in the same module/class
- **Consistent Structure**: Follow the same organizational pattern throughout the codebase

### Error Handling
- **Fail Fast**: Detect and handle errors as early as possible
- **Meaningful Error Messages**: Provide context about what went wrong and why
- **Use Exceptions Not Error Codes**: Prefer throwing exceptions over returning error codes
- **Don't Ignore Errors**: Always handle or explicitly propagate errors

### Documentation & Comments
- **Self-Documenting Code**: Write code that doesn't need comments to be understood
- **Explain Why, Not What**: Comments should explain the reasoning, not describe the code
- **Keep Comments Updated**: Outdated comments are worse than no comments
- **Document Complex Algorithms**: Add comments for non-obvious implementations

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- **Extract Common Logic**: Create reusable functions for repeated code patterns
- **Single Source of Truth**: Each piece of knowledge should have one authoritative representation
- **Avoid Copy-Paste**: If you're copying code, consider creating a shared function

### Testing Practices
- **Test First for Bugs**: Write a failing test before fixing any bug
- **Readable Tests**: Test names should clearly describe what is being tested
- **Test Edge Cases**: Include tests for boundary conditions and error scenarios
- **Keep Tests Fast**: Unit tests should run quickly to encourage frequent execution

### Code Quality Maintenance
- **Continuous Refactoring**: Improve code structure whenever you work on it
- **Leave Code Cleaner**: Always leave code better than you found it (Boy Scout Rule)
- **Fix Technical Debt Early**: Address code smells immediately before they compound
- **Regular Code Reviews**: Have peers review code for quality and standards compliance

## **Code Quality Standards**

### Information & Change Management
- **Verify Before Implementation**: Always verify requirements and design before coding
- **Incremental Changes**: Make changes file by file, allowing for review and feedback
- **Preserve Functionality**: Maintain existing code functionality unless explicitly changing it
- **Targeted Modifications**: Make precise, intentional changes without scope creep

### Professional Communication
- **Direct Communication**: Avoid unnecessary confirmations or apologies in code comments
- **Clear Documentation**: Document what and why, not obvious implementations
- **No Speculation**: Base all decisions on requirements and design documents
- **Factual Reporting**: Report completion status without unnecessary elaboration

### Implementation Discipline
- **Explicit Requirements Only**: Do not invent features beyond specified requirements
- **Respect Architecture**: Maintain existing code patterns and architecture
- **No Unnecessary Updates**: Avoid refactoring unrelated code while implementing features
- **Clear Boundaries**: Stay within the scope of the assigned task

## **Git Workflow & Version Control**

### Branch Management
```bash
# Branch naming conventions
feature/[task-id]-descriptive-name   # New features
bugfix/[issue-id]-brief-description  # Bug fixes
hotfix/[issue-id]-critical-fix       # Production fixes
release/v[version]-preparation       # Release preparation
```

### Commit Standards
```bash
# Commit message format
type(scope): description

# Types:
feat: New feature implementation
fix: Bug fix
docs: Documentation updates
refactor: Code refactoring without behavior change
test: Adding or updating tests
chore: Maintenance tasks
perf: Performance improvements
style: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)

# Examples:
feat(poi): implement nearby POI search functionality
fix(auth): resolve token refresh race condition
docs(api): update endpoint documentation
refactor(data): optimize repository pattern implementation
```

### Pull Request Best Practices
- **Branch Updates**: Keep feature branches up-to-date with develop
- **Small PRs**: Keep pull requests focused and manageable
- **Clear Descriptions**: Provide context and testing instructions
- **Link Issues**: Reference related tasks or bug reports
- **CI/CD Compliance**: Ensure all checks pass before merging

### Version Control Discipline
- **Never Force Push**: Except on personal feature branches
- **No Direct Main Commits**: All changes through pull requests
- **Clean History**: Use meaningful commit messages
- **Atomic Commits**: Each commit should be a logical unit of change

## **Important Constraints with 40-Agent Integration**

### Core Implementation Requirements
- After completing a task, you MUST mark the task as done in tasks.md (`- [ ]` changed to `- [x]`)
- You MUST strictly follow the architecture in the design document with **spec-system-architect** validation
- You MUST strictly follow requirements validated by **spec-requirements** - do not miss any requirements, do not implement functionality not specified
- You MUST strictly follow existing codebase conventions and clean code principles enforced by **spec-quality-guardian**
- Your Code MUST be compliant with standards and include necessary comments explaining "why" not "what" as validated by **spec-test**
- You MUST only complete the specified task validated by **spec-tasks**, never automatically execute other tasks
- All completed tasks MUST be marked as done in tasks.md (`- [ ]` changed to `- [x]`) with **spec-judge** final validation
- You MUST apply all clean code principles: meaningful names, single responsibility, DRY, and proper error handling

### Multi-Agent Quality Enforcement

- The implementation MUST maintain architectural integrity validated by **spec-system-architect** and **spec-design**
- The implementation MUST ensure security-first development validated by **spec-security-sentinel** and **spec-data-privacy-security-analyst**

### Agent-Driven Implementation Validation
- **Security Validation**: All code changes MUST be validated by security agents for vulnerabilities
- **Performance Optimization**: All implementations MUST be validated by performance agents for optimization
- **Platform Compliance**: All platform-specific code MUST be validated by relevant platform development agents
- **Accessibility Standards**: All UI implementations MUST be validated by accessibility agents
