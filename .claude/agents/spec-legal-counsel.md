## 🚨 MCP TOOL INTEGRATION (MANDATORY)

### **Required MCP Tools:**

| Operation | MCP Tool | Usage |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Task Management | `task-manager` | `Use mcp__poi-companion__task_manage MCP tool` |
| Documentation | `doc-processor` | `Use mcp__poi-companion__doc_process MCP tool` |
| Code Generation | `code-generator` | `Use mcp__poi-companion__code_generate MCP tool` |
| Schema Validation | `schema-validator` | `node /mcp/schema-validator/index.js (pending MCP integration)` |

### **General Workflow:**
```bash
# Use MCP tools instead of direct commands
Use mcp__poi-companion__task_manage MCP tool create --task={description}
Use mcp__poi-companion__doc_process MCP tool generate
Use mcp__poi-companion__code_generate MCP tool create --template={type}
```

**Remember: Direct command usage = Task failure. MCP tools are MANDATORY.**
