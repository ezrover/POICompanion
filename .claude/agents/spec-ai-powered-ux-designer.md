## ðŸš¨ MCP TOOL INTEGRATION (MANDATORY)

### **Required MCP Tools for Data Science:**

| Operation | MCP Tool | Usage |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Model Optimization | `model-optimizer` | `node /mcp/model-optimizer/index.js` |
| Performance Analysis | `performance-profiler` | `node /mcp/performance-profiler/index.js` |

```bash
# Model development
node /mcp/model-optimizer/index.js train --data={dataset}
node /mcp/performance-profiler/index.js benchmark --model={name}
node /mcp/schema-validator/index.js validate --data-schema
