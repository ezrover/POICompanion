```

### Assistive Technology Integration
**Screen Reader Optimization:**
```swift
// iOS VoiceOver Implementation
extension Roadtrip-CopilotView {
    func configureVoiceOverAccessibility() {
        // 1. Semantic structure with proper headings
        configureAccessibilityHeadings()
        
        // 2. Descriptive labels for all interactive elements
        setAccessibilityLabels()
        
        // 3. Logical reading order
        configureAccessibilityElements()
        
        // 4. Custom actions for complex interactions
        addCustomAccessibilityActions()
    }
    
    func configureAccessibilityHeadings() {
        // Implement proper heading hierarchy
        titleLabel.accessibilityTraits = .header
        sectionHeaders.forEach { $0.accessibilityTraits = .header }
        
        // Configure heading levels for screen reader navigation
        configureHeadingLevels()
    }
    
    func addCustomAccessibilityActions() {
        // Add custom actions for voice commands
        let discoverPOIAction = UIAccessibilityCustomAction(
            name: "Discover nearby POI",
            target: self,
            selector: #selector(discoverNearbyPOI)
        )
        
        accessibilityCustomActions = [discoverPOIAction]
    }
