## Development Notes

### iOS Specific
- Uses SwiftUI for modern iOS development
- Implements MapKit for native mapping
- Speech framework for voice recognition
- Background location with proper power management

### Android Specific  
- Jetpack Compose for modern Android UI
- Google Maps SDK for mapping functionality
- Android Speech Recognition API
- Foreground service for background operation

### Voice Commands Supported
- **"Save"** / "Favorite" / "Bookmark" â†’ Save POI
- **"Like"** / "Love" / "Good" â†’ Like POI
- **"Dislike"** / "Skip" / "Bad" â†’ Dislike POI  
- **"Next"** / "Forward" â†’ Next POI
- **"Previous"** / "Back" â†’ Previous POI
- **"Navigate"** / "Directions" â†’ Get directions
- **"Call"** / "Phone" â†’ Call location

### Testing Recommendations

1. **Simulator Testing**: Test basic UI and flows
2. **Device Testing**: Test location, speech, and background operation
3. **CarPlay/Android Auto**: Test automotive integration
4. **Voice Commands**: Test all voice recognition patterns
5. **Background Operation**: Test location tracking during navigation

## Troubleshooting

### iOS Issues
- **Build Errors**: Check iOS deployment target (15.0+)
- **CarPlay Not Working**: Verify entitlements and provisioning profile
- **Speech Recognition**: Test on physical device (not simulator)
- **Location Permission**: Check Info.plist usage descriptions

### Android Issues  
- **Maps Not Loading**: Verify Google Maps API key configuration
- **Build Errors**: Check SDK versions and Gradle sync
- **Android Auto**: Enable developer mode and unknown sources
- **Background Location**: Test on API 29+ for background restrictions

## Production Deployment

### iOS App Store
1. Configure production provisioning profiles
2. Add CarPlay entitlements via Apple Developer Portal
3. Archive and upload via Xcode or Transporter

### Google Play Store
1. Generate signed APK/AAB
2. Configure Play Console listing
3. Submit for review

## API Keys Required

### Google Services (Android)
- Google Maps API Key
- Places API access
- Directions API access

### Apple Services (iOS)
- MapKit (included with iOS)
- CarPlay entitlements (production only)

## Support

For development issues:
1. Check build logs and error messages
2. Verify all dependencies are properly installed
3. Ensure proper API key configuration
4. Test on physical devices for location and speech features

The project is configured with proper automotive UX patterns and should work seamlessly once API keys are configured and proper permissions are granted.
