## Key Testing Requirements

### Voice Command Testing (7 Core Commands)
1. **Save/Favorite** - "save", "favorite", "bookmark", "remember"
2. **Like** - "like", "love", "good", "great", "awesome"
3. **Dislike** - "dislike", "skip", "bad", "not interested", "pass", "hate"
4. **Next** - "next", "forward", "continue", "move on"
5. **Previous** - "previous", "back", "go back", "last one", "before"
6. **Navigate** - "navigate", "directions", "go to", "take me to", "drive to"
7. **Call** - "call", "phone", "contact", "dial"

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Speech Recognition Start**: < 200ms
- **Voice Command Processing**: < 350ms
- **TTS Response**: < 500ms
- **UI Animation Response**: < 100ms
- **Memory Usage**: < 150MB baseline
- **Battery Impact**: < 5% per hour active use

### Accessibility Requirements
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44pt (iOS) / 48dp (Android)
- **Voice Feedback**: All actions must have audio confirmation
- **Screen Reader**: Full VoiceOver/TalkBack support
- **Contrast Ratio**: 4.5:1 minimum for automotive visibility
- **Font Scaling**: Support up to 200% text size

### Automotive Environment Testing
- **Glare Resistance**: UI visible in direct sunlight
- **Vibration Tolerance**: Touch accuracy during vehicle movement
- **Audio Quality**: Clear speech synthesis over road noise
- **Interruption Handling**: Graceful handling of phone calls, notifications

## Test Execution Strategy

### Pre-Commit Testing
```bash
# iOS
xcodebuild test -scheme RoadtripCopilot -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 14 Pro'

# Android
./gradlew test connectedAndroidTest
```

### Performance Monitoring
- Continuous integration with performance regression detection
- Memory leak detection using Instruments (iOS) and LeakCanary (Android)
- Voice response time monitoring with alerts for > 350ms responses

### Accessibility Validation
- Automated accessibility testing with pa11y-like tools
- Manual validation with actual VoiceOver/TalkBack users
- Automotive environment simulation testing

## Medical Device Compliance Testing

### FDA Requirements Integration
- **Class B Software Testing**: Statement coverage for safety-related functions
- **Traceability Matrix**: Requirements to test case mapping
- **Risk-Based Testing**: Critical path testing for emergency scenarios
- **Documentation**: Complete test execution records with timestamps

### Safety-Critical Test Cases
