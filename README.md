## Roadtrip-Copilot: The Expedia of Roadside Discoveries

### 🚀 Revolutionary User-Powered Content Creation & Discovery Economy

HMI2.ai is building the world's first user-powered content creation and discovery economy. Our flagship product, Roadtrip-Copilot, transforms roadside discovery into a self-sustaining ecosystem where users can earn unlimited FREE roadtrips by being the first to discover new places. This is powered by a revolutionary distributed RAG architecture and a viral referral system.

### 🌟 Key Innovations

- **First-Discovery Economics**: Users earn revenue for discovering new POIs not in our database.
- **Automated UGC Monetization**: AI-generated videos from discoveries are posted to social media, with a 50/50 revenue split.
- **Viral Referral System**: A multi-tiered referral program that rewards users for growing the community.
- **Pay-Per-Roadtrip Model**: A simple $0.50/trip pricing model, with 7 free trips to start.
