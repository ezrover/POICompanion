## Examples

```bash
# Quick iOS build verification
node mobile-build-verifier ios

# Build both platforms with automatic fixes
node mobile-build-verifier both --fix

# Clean build with history analysis
node mobile-build-verifier android --clean --history

# Detailed error analysis for debugging
node mobile-build-verifier ios --detailed --fix
```

## Build History & Analytics

### Tracked Metrics
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful builds over time
- **Average Build Time**: Performance tracking for build optimization
- **Error Frequency**: Most common error types and their occurrence
- **Build Trends**: Whether builds are improving or declining
- **Last Successful Build**: Timestamp of last working build

### History Display
```bash
node mobile-build-verifier ios --history
