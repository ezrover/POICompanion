# Build Master

This tool automates the build and deployment process for different platforms.

## Usage

```bash
node build-master <platform> <action>
```

-   `<platform>`: The target platform (e.g., `ios`, `android`, `web`).
-   `<action>`: The action to perform (e.g., `build`, `deploy`, `test`).

## Example

```bash
node build-master ios build
node build-master android deploy
```
