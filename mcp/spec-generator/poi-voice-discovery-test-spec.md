## TDD Implementation Strategy

### Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

1. **RED**: Write failing test first
   ```javascript
   test('should recognize "Hey Companion" voice trigger', async () => {
     const voiceInput = mockVoiceInput('Hey Companion');
     const result = await voiceRecognition.process(voiceInput);
     expect(result.triggered).toBe(true);
     expect(result.responseTime).toBeLessThan(350);
   });
   ```

2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to pass test
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code while maintaining test pass

### Test-First Development Phases

1. **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing
2. **Integration Tests**: Cross-component interaction
3. **Accessibility Tests**: WCAG/NHTSA compliance  
4. **Performance Tests**: Response time/memory validation
5. **E2E Tests**: Complete user journey testing

## FDA Medical Device Testing Standards

### IEC 62304 Compliance Requirements
- **Software Classification**: Class B (statement coverage required)
- **Risk Management**: ISO 14971 integration
- **Traceability**: Requirements → Test mapping
- **Validation**: User needs verification

### Test Documentation Requirements
- **Test Plans**: Complete test strategy documentation
- **Test Results**: Detailed execution records with timestamps
