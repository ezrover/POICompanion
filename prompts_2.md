### 2025-08-11: Fix destination speech recognition platform parity
**USER**: Fix the destination speech recognition to ensure platform parity across iOS CarPlay, Android, and Android Auto. 

REQUIREMENTS:
1. When in destination selection mode, speech recognition should accept ANY spoken words (city names, POI names, addresses, etc.) as the destination
2. After detecting 3 seconds of silence, use the captured speech as the destination search query
3. Do NOT try to match command patterns when in destination selection mode
4. Ensure this works identically on:
   - iOS CarPlay (CarPlaySceneDelegate.swift)
   - Android main app (SpeechManager.kt, EnhancedDestinationSelectionScreen.kt)
   - Android Auto (RoadtripCarService.kt)

CURRENT ISSUE:
The speech recognition is trying to match command patterns (like "navigate", "go to", etc.) instead of accepting raw destination names like "San Francisco", "Starbucks", "Golden Gate Bridge", etc.

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
1. Add a "destinationMode" flag to SpeechManager on both platforms
2. When destinationMode is true, skip all command pattern matching
3. Implement a 3-second silence detection timer that triggers destination search
4. Broadcast/notify with the raw speech text as destination
5. Ensure the destination selection screens on all platforms set destinationMode = true when voice input starts

**CLAUDE**: Successfully implemented destination speech recognition platform parity with the following key changes:

### Android Implementation:
**SpeechManager.kt**:
- Added `isDestinationMode` StateFlow flag to control speech processing mode
- Implemented destination-specific silence detection with 3-second timer
- Added `enableDestinationMode()` and `disableDestinationMode()` methods
- Modified `onResults()` and `onPartialResults()` to handle destination mode separately
- Added `DESTINATION_SELECTED` broadcast constant for communication

**EnhancedDestinationSelectionScreen.kt**:
- Enables destination mode on screen launch
- Sets up broadcast receiver for destination selection results
- Re-enables destination mode when voice button is tapped
- Properly disables destination mode on screen disposal

**RoadtripCarService.kt** (Android Auto):
- Enables destination mode when starting voice destination search
- Sets up destination selection broadcast receiver
- Handles destination mode cleanup properly

### iOS Implementation:
**SpeechManager.swift**:
- Added `@Published var isDestinationMode` flag
- Implemented destination-specific silence detection with Timer
- Added `enableDestinationMode()` and `disableDestinationMode()` methods
- Modified speech recognition to handle destination mode processing
- Added `destinationSelected` notification name

**CarPlaySceneDelegate.swift**:
- Enables destination mode during destination search
- Sets up notification observer for destination selection
- Handles destination mode state management in voice search flow
- Properly disables destination mode when exiting destination selection

### Key Features Achieved:
✅ **Platform Parity**: Identical behavior across Android main app, Android Auto, and iOS CarPlay
✅ **Raw Destination Acceptance**: Speech like "San Francisco", "Starbucks", "Golden Gate Bridge" now works
✅ **3-Second Silence Detection**: Automatic processing after voice activity stops
✅ **No Command Pattern Matching**: Bypasses all "navigate to", "go to" pattern requirements  
✅ **Proper State Management**: Automatic mode switching for seamless UX
✅ **Background Integration**: Works properly with broadcast/notification systems

The implementation ensures users can simply say destination names like "Big Sur" or "Monterey Bay Aquarium" without needing command prefixes, with consistent behavior across all automotive platforms.

### 2025-08-13: Implement Set Destination Screen for iOS and CarPlay
**USER**: You need to implement the Set Destination screen for iOS and CarPlay based on the comprehensive design specifications.

Review the design specifications and existing codebase:
- /Users/naderrahimizad/Projects/AI/POICompanion/specs/UX-design/set-destination-screen-design.md (new design spec)
- /Users/naderrahimizad/Projects/AI/POICompanion/mobile/ios/ (existing iOS implementation)

Key implementation requirements:
1. **Layout**: Two-button layout with destination search input bar
   - Start/Go/Navigate button immediately right of destination input
   - Mic/Mute button immediately right of Start button
   - 56px touch targets for automotive safety

2. **Voice Integration**:
   - Start button responds to "go", "navigate", "start" speech commands
   - Mic button responds to "mute"/"unmute" speech commands
   - Voice animation replaces Start button icon during speech detection
   - Animation restores after 2 seconds of silence

3. **CarPlay Integration**:
   - Native CarPlay template implementation
   - Automotive-optimized touch targets (44pt minimum)
   - Siri integration for voice commands

4. **Test Case Implementation**:
   - Handle "Lost Lake, Oregon, Go" voice input
   - Process "Go" command to navigate to POI Main screen
   - Voice feedback and visual state transitions

Focus on:
- **SwiftUI Implementation**: Modern iOS UI patterns with state management
- **Voice Recognition**: Integration with existing SpeechManager
- **CarPlay Templates**: Automotive-specific UI patterns
- **Accessibility**: VoiceOver support, Dynamic Type, high contrast
- **Performance**: <100ms button response, smooth animations
- **Platform Parity**: Foundation for Android implementation consistency

Create or update the necessary Swift files in the iOS project:
- Update existing destination/search views
- Implement voice animation components
- Add CarPlay template extensions
- Update speech command handling
- Add test cases for the specified functionality

Provide complete, production-ready Swift/SwiftUI code that integrates seamlessly with the existing iOS codebase while maintaining the voice-first, automotive-safety design principles.
