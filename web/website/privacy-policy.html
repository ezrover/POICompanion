            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground pt-4 border-t border-border">Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h2>
            <p>HMI2.ai, Inc. ("HMI2.ai", "we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. Roadtrip-Copilot has been designed from the ground up to be a privacy-first application. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile applications, websites, and services (collectively, the "Services").</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground pt-4 border-t border-border">The Core Principle: On-Device Processing</h2>
            <p>Our fundamental privacy promise is that **all of your sensitive personal data is processed and stored directly on your device.** This includes:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-4 mt-2">
                    <li>Your precise location and location history.</li>
                    <li>Your user preferences and interaction history.</li>
                    <li>The content of your voice commands.</li>
                </ul>
            This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to share it or use a cloud-based feature.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground pt-4 border-t border-border">Information We Collect</h2>

                <li><strong>Anonymous Analytics (Optional):</strong> If you choose to opt-in, we collect anonymized and aggregated usage data to help us understand how our Services are used and to improve them. This data cannot be used to identify you personally.</li>
