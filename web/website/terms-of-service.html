            <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 7, 2025</p>

            <p>Welcome to Roadtrip-Copilot! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of our mobile applications, websites, and services (collectively, the "Services"), provided by HMI2.ai, Inc. ("HMI2.ai", "we", "us", or "our").</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground pt-4 border-t border-border">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>By accessing or using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use our Services.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground pt-4 border-t border-border">2. The Services</h2>
            <p>Roadtrip-Copilot provides an AI-powered assistant for roadside discovery. Our Services include a pay-per-roadtrip model and a creator economy where users can earn rewards for discovering new points of interest.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-foreground pt-2">2.1. Pay-Per-Roadtrip Model</h3>
            <p>After an initial free trial period (currently 7 free roadtrips), you may purchase additional "roadtrips" to continue using the full features of the Services. Each purchased roadtrip allows for unlimited discoveries within a single, continuous journey.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-foreground pt-2">2.2. Creator Economy & First-Discovery Program</h3>
            <p>Our Creator Economy allows you to earn rewards for your discoveries. Hereâ€™s how it works:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-4 space-y-2 mt-2">
                <li><strong>First-Discovery Rule:</strong> You are only eligible to earn revenue from Points of Interest (POIs) that are **new** and not already present in our database at the time of your discovery.</li>
                <li><strong>Automated Content Creation:</strong> For eligible first discoveries, our Service may automatically generate short video content which may be posted on social media platforms (e.g., YouTube, TikTok, Instagram).</li>
                <li><strong>Revenue Share:</strong> You will receive 50% of the net advertising revenue generated by the video content from your first discoveries.</li>
                <li><strong>Reward Conversion:</strong> All earnings are automatically converted into "Roadtrip Credits" in your account at a rate of $0.50 per credit. Each credit can be used for one roadtrip in the app.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By using the Service, you grant HMI2.ai a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, and distribute the content generated from your discoveries.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground pt-4 border-t border-border">3. User Conduct and Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>You agree to use our Services responsibly and in compliance with all applicable laws. You are solely responsible for your conduct while driving. **Always prioritize safety and obey all traffic laws.** Do not interact with the app in a way that distracts you from driving.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground pt-4 border-t border-border">4. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>The Services and their original content, features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of HMI2.ai and its licensors. By submitting content through the Creator Economy, you grant HMI2.ai a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, and distribute that content.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground pt-4 border-t border-border">5. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. HMI2.AI DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, OR USEFULNESS OF ANY INFORMATION ON THE SERVICE AND NEITHER ADOPTS NOR ENDORSES, NOR IS RESPONSIBLE FOR, THE ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY OF ANY OPINION, ADVICE, OR STATEMENT MADE.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground pt-4 border-t border-border">6. Governing Law</h2>
            <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground pt-4 border-t border-border">7. Changes to Terms</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. We will provide at least 30 days' notice before any new terms take effect.</p>
