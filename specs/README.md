## 🎯 Document Organization Philosophy

This reorganized specification structure follows a **purpose-driven approach** to make information easy to find and use:

### ✅ **Benefits of New Structure**
- **Clear Purpose Separation**: Each folder has a distinct role in the development process
- **Reduced Redundancy**: Consolidated overlapping content from 47+ scattered documents
- **Developer-Friendly**: Technical teams can quickly find implementation details
- **Stakeholder-Ready**: Business teams can access product vision without technical complexity
- **Maintenance Efficient**: Single source of truth for each domain

### 🔄 **Migration from Previous Structure**
The previous `/specs/` folder contained 47+ documents across multiple subdirectories. This reorganization consolidates them into **~20 focused documents** organized by purpose rather than technology.
