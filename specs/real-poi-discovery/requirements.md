# Real POI Discovery - Requirements Specification

**Feature Name:** `real-poi-discovery`  
**Created:** 2025-08-14  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Priority:** HIGH

## Executive Summary

Replace the current mocked POI data system with a comprehensive real POI discovery solution that leverages on-device Gemma-3N LLM analysis with intelligent online API failover. This system will provide users with accurate, relevant, and locally-sourced points of interest while maintaining <350ms response times and automotive safety compliance.

## 1. Functional Requirements (EARS Format)

### REQ-POI-001: LLM-Based Local Analysis
**WHEN** a user requests POI discovery for a location  
**THE SYSTEM** shall use the integrated Gemma-3N model to analyze local knowledge and generate relevant POI suggestions  
**WHERE** response time is <350ms for initial results

### REQ-POI-002: Online API Failover
**WHEN** the local LLM lacks sufficient POI data for a location  
**THE SYSTEM** shall automatically query online APIs (Google Places, OpenStreetMap, Yelp) as backup  
**WHERE** fallback occurs within 500ms of LLM analysis completion

### REQ-POI-003: Platform Parity Enforcement
**WHEN** POI discovery is implemented on one platform (iOS/Android)  
**THE SYSTEM** shall provide identical functionality and response formats on all platforms  
**WHERE** both mobile and automotive platforms (CarPlay/Android Auto) maintain 100% feature parity

### REQ-POI-004: Mock Data Elimination
**WHEN** any POI search is executed  
**THE SYSTEM** shall never return hardcoded mock responses from ToolRegistry classes  
**WHERE** all responses contain real, verifiable POI data with actual coordinates

### REQ-POI-005: Intelligent POI Filtering
**WHEN** POI results are generated  
**THE SYSTEM** shall apply the Enhanced Tool Registry exclusion system to filter out unwanted chains and gas stations  
**WHERE** users receive curated, locally-relevant discoveries

### REQ-POI-006: Automotive Safety Compliance
**WHEN** POI discovery runs in automotive environments  
**THE SYSTEM** shall prioritize voice-friendly descriptions and minimize visual complexity  
**WHERE** CarPlay/Android Auto guidelines are fully adhered to

### REQ-POI-007: Performance Optimization
**WHEN** multiple POI queries are executed  
**THE SYSTEM** shall cache LLM analysis and API responses locally  
**WHERE** subsequent queries for the same area return in <100ms

### REQ-POI-008: Real-time Data Integration
**WHEN** POI information is presented to users  
**THE SYSTEM** shall include current operating hours, ratings, and availability status  
**WHERE** data freshness is indicated with timestamps

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time:** <350ms for LLM analysis, <1000ms total including API failover
- **Memory Usage:** <50MB additional RAM for POI caching and model inference
- **Battery Impact:** <2% additional battery usage per 10 POI queries
- **Cache Efficiency:** 70% cache hit rate for frequently searched areas

### Security Requirements
- All API keys encrypted and stored in secure keychain/keystore
- Location data never transmitted without user consent
- POI search history optionally stored locally only
- GDPR/CCPA compliance for data collection and retention

### Scalability Requirements
- Support for 1000+ cached POI locations per user
- Graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable
- Rate limiting for external API calls (100 requests/hour per user)

### Reliability Requirements
- 99.5% uptime for local LLM analysis
- Automatic retry logic for failed API calls (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
- Fallback to basic location search when all POI sources fail

## 3. User Stories

### Epic: POI Discovery Enhancement

**Story 1: LLM-Powered Local Discovery**
- **As a** roadtrip user exploring "Lost Lake, Oregon"  
- **I want** the AI to use its knowledge to suggest nearby hidden gems  
- **So that** I discover authentic local experiences beyond generic chains

**Story 2: Intelligent Failover**
- **As a** user searching for POIs in a remote area  
- **I want** the system to automatically search online when local knowledge is limited  
- **So that** I always receive relevant results regardless of location obscurity

**Story 3: Automotive Safety**
- **As a** driver using CarPlay/Android Auto  
- **I want** POI suggestions to be voice-optimized and automotive-friendly  
- **So that** I can safely discover places without visual distractions

**Story 4: Platform Consistency**
- **As a** user switching between iPhone and Android devices  
- **I want** identical POI discovery results and functionality  
- **So that** my experience remains consistent across platforms

**Story 5: Real Data Validation**
- **As a** user relying on POI suggestions  
- **I want** all information to be accurate and current  
- **So that** I don't encounter closed businesses or outdated information

## 4. Technical Constraints

### Platform Constraints
- **iOS:** Must utilize Core ML optimized Gemma-3N model
- **Android:** Must utilize TFLite optimized Gemma-3N model  
- **Memory:** Model inference within existing 1.5GB RAM budget
