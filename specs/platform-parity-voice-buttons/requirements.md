# Platform Parity Voice Buttons - Requirements Document

**Feature Name**: platform-parity-voice-buttons  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-08-13  
**Author**: spec-requirements (AI Agent)  
**Language Preference**: Clear, concise technical documentation with precise specifications

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document specifies requirements for achieving 100% platform parity between iOS and Android for button styling and voice recognition auto-start behavior. Critical issues include Android buttons having borders/square shapes that must match iOS borderless design, missing voice recognition auto-start functionality, and incorrect mic button behavior.

## 2. BUSINESS OBJECTIVES

- **BO1**: Maintain 100% feature parity across all four platforms (iOS, Android, CarPlay, Android Auto)
- **BO2**: Ensure consistent user experience for voice interaction patterns
- **BO3**: Eliminate platform-specific UI/UX inconsistencies
- **BO4**: Comply with automotive safety standards across all platforms

## 3. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (EARS FORMAT)

### FR001: Button Styling Parity
**WHEN** the application renders buttons on Android platform, the system **SHALL** display buttons with borderless design matching iOS exactly:
- No outline borders visible
- No circular or square background shapes  
- Only the icon visible with proper design token corner radii (8dp, 12dp, 16dp)
- Material Design 3 icon button implementation

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Android buttons visually identical to iOS buttons
- [ ] No CircleShape or square borders on any buttons
- [ ] Design tokens applied consistently (DesignTokens.CornerRadius.lg = 12dp)
- [ ] Touch targets meet minimum 48dp Android / 44pt iOS requirements

### FR002: Voice Recognition Auto-Start on Screen Entry
**WHEN** the user navigates to SetDestinationScreen or VoiceConfirmationScreen, the system **SHALL** automatically start voice recognition:
- Voice recognition activates immediately upon screen entry
- No manual microphone button tap required to begin listening
- Audio session configured for continuous listening

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Voice recognition starts automatically on SetDestinationScreen entry
- [ ] Voice recognition starts automatically on VoiceConfirmationScreen entry  
- [ ] Audio session properly configured without user interaction
- [ ] Behavior identical between iOS and Android

### FR003: Microphone Button Mute/Unmute Toggle Behavior
**WHEN** the user taps the microphone button during active voice recognition, the system **SHALL** toggle mute/unmute state only:
- Microphone button acts as mute/unmute toggle exclusively
- Does NOT start/stop voice recognition session
- Visual feedback indicates mute/unmute state clearly

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Mic button toggles mute/unmute during active voice session
- [ ] Mic button does NOT start new voice recognition sessions
- [ ] Visual state clearly indicates muted vs unmuted status
- [ ] Behavior consistent across iOS and Android

### FR004: Cross-Platform Documentation Requirements
**WHEN** platform parity requirements are updated, the system documentation **SHALL** reflect mandatory cross-platform requirements:
- Auto-start voice recognition documented as mandatory behavior
- Mic button mute/unmute behavior specified
- Borderless button design requirements documented

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Requirements documentation updated with voice auto-start mandate
- [ ] Button design system updated with borderless requirements
- [ ] Platform parity enforcement documented in development workflow

### FR005: AI Agent Workflow Enforcement (NEW MANDATORY REQUIREMENT)
**WHEN** any future development affects voice interaction or button design, the system **SHALL** enforce mandatory AI agent usage:
- spec-ux-user-experience MUST review all voice interaction changes
- spec-ios-developer + spec-android-developer MUST coordinate platform implementation
- spec-judge MUST validate platform parity before completion
- Direct implementation bypassing agents triggers automatic task failure

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Voice interaction changes require mandatory agent orchestration
- [ ] Platform parity validation enforced through spec-judge
- [ ] Agent auto-activation triggers for voice/button modifications
- [ ] Violation consequences documented and enforced

### FR006: Spec-Judge Platform Parity Validation (NEW MANDATORY REQUIREMENT)
**WHEN** voice or button implementations are completed, spec-judge **SHALL** validate 100% platform parity:
- Voice auto-start timing verification across all platforms
- Mic button behavior consistency validation
- Borderless button design compliance checking
- CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility verification

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] spec-judge validates voice auto-start behavior across platforms
- [ ] spec-judge confirms mic button mute/unmute functionality
- [ ] spec-judge verifies borderless button design compliance
- [ ] spec-judge ensures CarPlay/Android Auto compatibility

## 4. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### NFR001: Performance Consistency
**WHEN** voice recognition auto-starts on screen entry, the system **SHALL** maintain response times within 10% variance between platforms:
- Voice recognition activation time: <100ms
- Button rendering time: <50ms
- Audio session setup time: <200ms

### NFR002: User Experience Consistency  
**WHEN** users interact with buttons or voice features, the system **SHALL** provide identical experience across platforms:
- Visual appearance exactly matching
- Interaction patterns identical
- Audio feedback consistent

### NFR003: Accessibility Compliance
**WHEN** users with accessibility needs interact with the system, the application **SHALL** maintain WCAG 2.1 AAA compliance:
- Voice control accessible without visual cues
- Button labels clearly announced by screen readers
- Touch targets meet accessibility guidelines

## 5. TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS

### TC001: Design System Integration
- **SHALL** use existing DesignTokens.kt (Android) and DesignTokens.swift (iOS)
- **SHALL** maintain design token consistency across platforms
- **SHALL NOT** introduce platform-specific button styling exceptions

### TC002: Voice Recognition Framework
- **SHALL** use existing voice recognition infrastructure
- **SHALL NOT** require new permissions or audio session changes
- **SHALL** maintain compatibility with CarPlay/Android Auto

### TC003: Backward Compatibility
- **SHALL** maintain existing voice command recognition functionality
- **SHALL NOT** break existing navigation and destination selection flows
- **SHALL** preserve existing accessibility features

## 6. DEPENDENCIES

### Internal Dependencies
- **ID001**: Existing button design system at `/specs/design/button-design-system.md`
- **ID002**: Current voice recognition implementation in both platforms
- **ID003**: DesignTokens implementation in both iOS and Android codebases

### External Dependencies
- **ED001**: Material Design 3 guidelines compliance (Android)
- **ED002**: Human Interface Guidelines compliance (iOS)
