# Auto Discover Feature Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Auto Discover feature introduces an intelligent POI discovery system that automatically finds and presents the top 10 highest-ranking Points of Interest within a preset distance from the user's current location. This feature enhances the existing Roadtrip-Copilot experience by providing a third navigation option alongside manual destination entry and voice-guided search, enabling users to discover interesting locations without specific destinations in mind.

The feature integrates seamlessly across all four platforms (iOS, Android, CarPlay, Android Auto) with voice command support, AI-generated content, automatic photo discovery, and persistent user preferences to create an engaging discovery experience that maintains 100% platform parity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Auto Discover Button Integration

**User Story:** As a roadtrip user, I want a dedicated "Auto Discover" button on the Select Destination screen, so that I can easily access discovery mode across all platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Select Destination screen loads THEN the system SHALL display three navigation options: manual entry, voice search, and "Auto Discover"
2. WHEN the user interacts with the "Auto Discover" button THEN the system SHALL maintain identical functionality across iOS, Android, CarPlay, and Android Auto platforms
3. WHERE the Select Destination screen is displayed THEN the "Auto Discover" button SHALL be prominently positioned as the third primary navigation option
4. WHEN the "Auto Discover" button is selected THEN the system SHALL immediately initiate discovery mode without additional confirmation dialogs

### Requirement 2: Intelligent POI Discovery and Ranking

**User Story:** As a discovery-minded traveler, I want the system to automatically find the top 10 highest-ranking POIs within my preferred distance, so that I can explore interesting locations without manual searching.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Auto Discover mode is activated THEN the system SHALL search within the user's preset distance preference for POI categories
2. WHEN POI search is initiated THEN the system SHALL apply ranking algorithms to identify the top 10 highest-ranking POIs
3. WHERE multiple POIs exist within the search radius THEN the system SHALL prioritize POIs based on rating, popularity, user preferences, and proximity
4. WHEN POI ranking is complete THEN the system SHALL order results by shortest distance to current location
5. IF no POIs are found within the preset distance THEN the system SHALL expand the search radius and notify the user

### Requirement 3: Automatic MainPOIView Transition

**User Story:** As a user initiating discovery, I want the app to automatically enter the MainPOIView displaying discovered POIs, so that I can immediately begin exploring without additional navigation steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the top 10 POIs are identified THEN the system SHALL automatically transition to MainPOIView
2. WHEN MainPOIView loads in discovery mode THEN the system SHALL display POIs in order from shortest to longest distance
3. WHERE MainPOIView is displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing POI display functionality
4. WHEN the POI list is presented THEN the system SHALL indicate the current POI position within the top 10 results

### Requirement 4: POI Navigation Controls

**User Story:** As a user exploring POIs, I want to navigate between discoveries using buttons or voice commands, so that I can efficiently browse through options hands-free while driving.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in discovery mode THEN the system SHALL provide '<' and '>' navigation buttons for POI browsing
2. WHEN the user activates voice commands THEN the system SHALL accept "next POI" and "previous POI" voice instructions
3. WHERE navigation controls are displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain identical functionality across all four platforms
4. WHEN the user reaches the end of the POI list THEN the system SHALL loop back to the first POI
5. WHILE voice recognition is active THEN the system SHALL process navigation commands within 350ms response time

### Requirement 5: Dislike Functionality and Persistent Storage

**User Story:** As a user with specific preferences, I want to dislike POIs I'm not interested in and have them remembered permanently, so that the system learns my preferences and automatically skips unwanted locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects the dislike button THEN the system SHALL store the POI in a permanent dislike list
2. WHEN a POI is disliked THEN the system SHALL immediately skip to the next POI in the discovery queue
3. WHERE dislike data is stored THEN the system SHALL persist preferences across app sessions and device restarts
4. WHEN future POI searches occur THEN the system SHALL automatically exclude all previously disliked POIs
5. IF all remaining POIs in the current search are disliked THEN the system SHALL expand the search radius to find additional options

### Requirement 6: Dynamic Heart Icon to Search Icon Transformation

**User Story:** As a user in discovery mode, I want the heart icon to change to a search icon that functions as a back button, so that I can easily return to the destination selection screen when I'm finished exploring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN discovery mode is activated THEN the system SHALL replace the heart icon with a search icon
2. WHEN the search icon is selected THEN the system SHALL function identically to the BACK button
3. WHERE the search icon is displayed THEN the system SHALL return the user to the Select Destination screen
4. WHEN returning from discovery mode THEN the system SHALL preserve the previous app state and user context

### Requirement 7: AI-Generated Podcast Content

**User Story:** As a curious traveler, I want to hear AI-generated podcast content about each POI, so that I can learn interesting information while driving without reading text.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in discovery mode THEN the system SHALL display a Speak/Info button to the right of the search icon
2. WHEN the Speak/Info button is selected THEN the system SHALL play AI-generated podcast content about the current POI
3. WHERE podcast content is generated THEN the system SHALL source information from internet data, reviews, and recommendations
4. WHEN podcast content is playing THEN the system SHALL allow users to pause, resume, or skip using voice commands
5. WHILE driving THEN the system SHALL prioritize audio content delivery over visual information display

### Requirement 8: Automatic Photo Discovery and Integration

**User Story:** As a visual person planning my route, I want to see the top 5 photos from internet and social media for each POI, so that I can visually assess locations before visiting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN each high-ranking POI is identified THEN the system SHALL automatically discover the top 5 photos from internet and social media sources
2. WHERE POI photos are displayed THEN the system SHALL prioritize high-quality, recent, and relevant images
3. WHEN photo discovery occurs THEN the system SHALL also gather associated reviews and user-generated content
4. IF insufficient photos are available THEN the system SHALL supplement with official venue photos or map imagery
5. WHILE photos are loading THEN the system SHALL display loading indicators and maintain app responsiveness

### Requirement 9: Automatic Photo Cycling System

**User Story:** As a user browsing POIs, I want photos to automatically cycle every 2 seconds and then move to the next POI's photos, so that I can passively view all discovery content without manual interaction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN POI photos are displayed THEN the system SHALL automatically cycle through all 5 photos at 2-second intervals
2. WHEN all photos for a POI have been displayed THEN the system SHALL automatically advance to the next POI's photo set

### Requirement 10: Continuous Operation and Exit Controls

**User Story:** As a user enjoying the discovery experience, I want the photo cycling to continue indefinitely until I choose to exit, so that I can passively explore content for as long as desired.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN discovery mode is active THEN the system SHALL continue photo cycling indefinitely until user intervention
2. WHEN the user selects BACK or Search buttons THEN the system SHALL immediately stop cycling and exit discovery mode
3. WHERE the app is closed THEN the system SHALL save the current discovery state and resume from the same position when reopened
