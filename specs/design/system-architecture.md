- **🔋 Battery Optimized**: <0.5% battery consumption per episode (70% improvement)
- **🌐 Offline-First**: Full multimodal AI capability without internet
- **💰 Cost Efficient**: 70% reduction in server costs with mobile-first processing
- **🎨 Multimodal Native**: Text, image, audio, and video processing in one model

### Native Platform Implementation Strategy

Roadtrip-Copilot employs a **native-first development approach** that prioritizes platform-specific performance and user experience over code sharing.

#### Key Architecture Principles

1. **Platform-Specific Native Implementation**:
   - **iOS**: Swift 5.9+ with SwiftUI for modern UI components, Core ML for AI acceleration
   - **Android**: Kotlin 1.9+ with Jetpack Compose for modern UI components, MediaPipe for AI acceleration
   - **Legacy Support**: UIKit for iOS legacy components, traditional Android Views for legacy support

2. **Shared Specifications, Not Shared Code**:
   - Business logic alignment through API contracts and behavior specifications
   - Platform-specific implementations following shared performance targets
   - Data model synchronization through platform-native data structures

3. **Native Platform Optimization**:
   - iOS-specific optimizations: Neural Engine acceleration, SwiftUI performance patterns
   - Android-specific optimizations: NPU/GPU/DSP acceleration, Compose performance patterns
   - Platform-specific hardware capability utilization for maximum performance
