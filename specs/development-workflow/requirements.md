# Development Workflow Requirements: Mandatory AI Agent Enforcement

## Document Information
- **Document Type**: Requirements Specification (EARS Format)
- **Feature Name**: development-workflow
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: 2025-08-13
- **Status**: FINAL - NON-NEGOTIABLE

## Executive Summary

This document establishes MANDATORY requirements for AI agent workforce utilization and spec-driven workflow enforcement for ALL future development in the POICompanion/Roadtrip-Copilot project. These requirements are NON-NEGOTIABLE and supersede all previous development approaches.

## Critical Problem Statement

**HISTORICAL FAILURE**: Past development bypassed the available 40-agent specialized workforce, leading to:
- Platform parity violations (iOS/Android inconsistencies)
- Quality regression issues (circular border reappearance)
- Direct implementation of complex features without agent oversight
- Inconsistent code quality and architecture decisions

**SOLUTION**: Establish absolute enforcement of AI agent workflow for ALL non-trivial development tasks.

## Scope and Applicability

### In Scope
- ALL feature development (new functionality)
- ALL bug fixes involving multiple files or complex logic  
- ALL platform parity implementations
- ALL UI/UX changes requiring design decisions
- ALL system architecture modifications
- ALL performance optimization tasks
- ALL security implementations
- ALL compliance requirements

### Out of Scope
- Simple file reads/writes (≤5 lines of code changes)
- Basic configuration updates
- Documentation formatting (non-content changes)
- Trivial typo corrections

## Stakeholders and Roles

### Primary Stakeholders
- **Development Team**: Must follow agent-first workflow
- **Project Maintainers**: Enforce compliance and review violations
- **AI Agent Workforce**: 40 specialized agents providing domain expertise

### Secondary Stakeholders
- **End Users**: Benefit from consistent quality and platform parity
- **Business Stakeholders**: Receive predictable delivery timelines

## Functional Requirements

### FR001: Mandatory Agent Utilization
**EARS Format**: The development workflow SHALL utilize the 40-agent specialized workforce for ALL non-trivial development tasks.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- FR001-AC001: ALL complex tasks (>3 steps, >10 lines of code) MUST be delegated to appropriate agents
- FR001-AC002: Direct implementation is PROHIBITED except for simple file operations
- FR001-AC003: Agent selection MUST follow the defined agent selection matrix (see FR005)
- FR001-AC004: Multiple agents MUST be coordinated through spec-judge for complex features

**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Violation Consequence**: AUTOMATIC TASK REJECTION

### FR002: Spec-Driven Workflow Enforcement  
**EARS Format**: The development process SHALL follow the mandatory spec-driven workflow: Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- FR002-AC001: ALL features MUST begin with spec-requirements agent creating requirements.md
- FR002-AC002: Design phase MUST use spec-design agent creating design.md
- FR002-AC003: Task planning MUST use spec-tasks agent creating tasks.md
- FR002-AC004: Implementation MUST reference approved specification documents
- FR002-AC005: NO phase may be skipped or combined without explicit justification

**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Violation Consequence**: WORKFLOW RESTART REQUIRED

### FR003: Platform Parity Enforcement
**EARS Format**: The development workflow SHALL ensure 100% feature parity across all four platforms: iOS, Android, CarPlay, and Android Auto.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Violation Consequence**: PLATFORM BUILD FAILURE = TASK FAILURE

### FR004: Automatic Agent Activation
**EARS Format**: The development workflow SHALL automatically activate appropriate agents based on task characteristics.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- FR004-AC001: Task analysis MUST trigger appropriate agent selection within 1 minute

- FR004-AC003: Conflicting or insufficient agent selection MUST trigger spec-judge arbitration
- FR004-AC004: Agent activation decisions MUST be logged and auditable

**Priority**: HIGH
**Auto-Activation Triggers**: See Agent Selection Matrix (Section 8)

### FR005: Quality Validation Through spec-judge

## Violation Consequences

### Level 1: Minor Violations
- **Trigger**: Improper agent selection, missing secondary agents
- **Consequence**: Warning + mandatory correction
- **Resolution**: Immediate agent engagement

### Level 2: Moderate Violations  
- **Trigger**: Workflow step skipping, incomplete spec-driven process
- **Consequence**: Task rejection + restart from appropriate phase
- **Resolution**: Complete workflow from violation point

### Level 3: Major Violations
- **Trigger**: Direct implementation of complex features, platform parity violations
- **Consequence**: Complete task rejection + mandatory re-planning
- **Resolution**: Full spec-driven workflow restart

### Level 4: Critical Violations
- **Trigger**: Systematic agent bypass, repeated major violations
- **Consequence**: Development privileges suspension + management escalation
- **Resolution**: Workflow training + supervised development

## Examples: Correct vs Incorrect Approaches

### Example 1: New Feature Development

**CORRECT Approach:**
1. Use spec-requirements agent → create requirements.md
2. Get user approval on requirements
3. Use spec-design agent → create design.md  
4. Get user approval on design
5. Use spec-tasks agent → create tasks.md
6. Get user approval on tasks
7. Use appropriate implementation agents (spec-ios-developer, spec-android-developer)
8. Use spec-judge for quality validation
9. Ensure platform parity before completion

**INCORRECT Approach:**
- Direct implementation without specifications
- Skipping requirements or design phases
- Single platform implementation without parity consideration
- No agent consultation for complex logic

### Example 2: UI/UX Bug Fix

**CORRECT Approach:**
1. Analyze bug scope and impact
2. Engage spec-ux-user-experience agent for design guidance
3. Engage platform-specific agents (spec-ios-developer, spec-android-developer)
4. Implement fixes with platform parity
5. Use spec-judge for validation
6. Test across all platforms

**INCORRECT Approach:**
- Direct fix without UX agent consultation
- Platform-specific fix without parity consideration
- No validation of design consistency

### Example 3: Simple File Update

**CORRECT Approach:**
1. Assess if truly simple (≤5 lines, single file, no logic changes)
2. If simple: Direct implementation allowed
3. If complex: Follow full agent workflow

**INCORRECT Approach:**
- Assuming complex changes are "simple"
- Direct implementation of multi-file changes
- Bypassing platform parity requirements

## Enforcement Mechanisms

### Automated Detection
- Pre-commit hooks scanning for agent workflow compliance
- Build system validation requiring platform parity
- Automated code review checking for specification references

### Manual Validation
- Code review checklist requiring agent workflow evidence  
- Quality gates requiring spec-judge validation approval
- Platform parity testing before merge approval

### Monitoring and Reporting
- Daily workflow compliance reports
- Violation tracking and trend analysis
- Agent utilization metrics and optimization

## Success Criteria

### Immediate Success (Week 1)
- 100% agent workflow adoption for new tasks
- Zero platform parity violations
- Complete spec-driven process for all features

### Short-term Success (Month 1)  
- 50% reduction in quality regressions
- 90% improvement in platform consistency
- Automated violation detection operational

### Long-term Success (Quarter 1)
- Zero workflow violations
- Enterprise-grade quality metrics achieved
- Full automation of agent orchestration

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Agent Unavailability
- **Mitigation**: Fallback to secondary agents, escalation to spec-judge
- **Contingency**: Manual expert review with documented justification

### Risk: Workflow Bottlenecks
- **Mitigation**: Parallel agent execution, time-boxed activities
- **Contingency**: Streamlined approval processes for urgent fixes

### Risk: Resistance to Change
- **Mitigation**: Training, clear examples, gradual enforcement
- **Contingency**: Management mandate with compliance tracking
