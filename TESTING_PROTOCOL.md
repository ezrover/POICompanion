# Roadtrip-Copilot Testing Protocol

**Version:** 2.0

**Author:** Gemini (`QualityGuardian` Agent)

## 1. Philosophy: Quality is Non-Negotiable

In a safety-critical automotive application that also manages a real-money economy for its users, quality is the bedrock of trust. This document establishes the testing protocol for the Roadtrip-Copilot project, shifting our mindset from "testing after coding" to **building quality in from the start**. We will adhere to a rigorous, test-driven approach to ensure every component of our system is robust, reliable, and correct by design.

## 2. The Test-Driven Development (TDD) Workflow

All new development will follow a Test-Driven Development workflow, adapted for our specific needs.

### 2.1. For Bug Fixes: The Classic TDD Cycle

1.  **Red:** Write a test that replicates the bug. This test **must fail**.
2.  **Green:** Write the simplest code to make the test pass.
3.  **Refactor:** Improve the code's design, ensuring the test continues to pass.

### 2.2. For New Features: Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

New features will be developed using a BDD approach.

1.  **Define Behavior:** Describe the feature's behavior using Gherkin-like syntax (`Given`, `When`, `Then`).
2.  **Write a Failing Acceptance Test:** Create a high-level test that implements the BDD scenario.
3.  **Implement with TDD:** Build the components required to make the acceptance test pass, using the classic TDD cycle.

## 3. The Testing Pyramid

We will adhere to the testing pyramid to ensure a fast and comprehensive test suite.

```mermaid

    subgraph Test Suite
        E2E(End-to-End Tests) -- Few --> Integration(Integration Tests) -- More --> Unit(Unit Tests) -- Many
    end
    style E2E fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style Integration fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style Unit fill:#cfc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### 3.1. Unit Tests
-   **Purpose:** Test individual components in isolation.
-   **Scope:** The smallest testable part of the application.
-   **Location:** Co-located with the source code.

### 3.2. Integration Tests
-   **Purpose:** Verify that different components work together as expected.
-   **Scope:** Interaction between two or more components.
-   **Location:** A separate `__tests__` or `integration` directory.

### 3.3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests
-   **Purpose:** Simulate a full user journey.
-   **Scope:** From the UI to the database and back.
-   **Tools:** Detox for React Native, or XCUITest/Espresso for native mobile.

## 4. Specialized Testing Strategies

### 4.1. Distributed RAG System Testing

-   **Component-Level Testing**: Each part of the RAG pipeline (data ingestion, processing, indexing, retrieval) will be tested independently.
-   **Integration Testing**: We will test the flow of data through the RAG pipeline, from user submission to inclusion in the knowledge base.
-   **End-to-End Testing**: Simulate user queries and validate the relevance and accuracy of the retrieved results.
-   **Load Testing**: Test the RAG system's performance under high load to ensure it can handle a large number of concurrent users.

### 4.2. UGC Monetization and Crowdsourcing Platform Testing

-   **Financial Logic Testing**: Rigorous testing of the revenue calculation, splitting, and credit conversion logic.
-   **Fraud Detection Testing**: Simulate fraudulent activities to validate the effectiveness of our fraud detection mechanisms.
-   **Payment Integration Testing**: Test the integration with Stripe Connect for secure and reliable payouts.
-   **Community Review Testing**: Test the community review system to ensure fairness and accuracy.

### 4.3. Viral Referral System Testing

-   **Attribution Logic Testing**: Test the referral tracking and attribution logic to ensure referrers are credited correctly.
-   **Reward System Testing**: Validate the logic for awarding referral credits and the integration with the user's credit balance.
-   **Social Sharing Testing**: Test the sharing functionality across all supported social media platforms.

## 5. Tools & Frameworks

-   **Testing Framework:** Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript, XCTest (iOS), and JUnit/Espresso (Android).
-   **Assertion Library:** Jest's `expect`, and native assertion libraries.
-   **Mocking:** Jest's built-in mocking, and platform-specific mocking frameworks.

## 6. Code Coverage

-   **Target:** A minimum of **85% code coverage** for all new code.
-   **Enforcement:** Code coverage checks will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.

## 7. Continuous Integration (CI)

-   **Automation:** All tests will be run automatically on every commit.
-   **Gating:** A pull request cannot be merged unless all tests pass and coverage thresholds are met.

By adhering to this protocol, we will build a product that is not only rich in features but also high in quality, giving us the confidence to innovate quickly and safely.
